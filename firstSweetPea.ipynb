    "Here, we want to create a balanced sequence for the Stroop task. In a Stroop task, an inked color word is shown. Here, we use four different stimuli: <span style=\"color:red\">RED</span>, <span style=\"color:blue\">BLUE</span>, <span style=\"color:red\">RED</span>, <span style=\"color:blue\">BLUE</span>. The task of the participant is to name the color of the word as fast as possible while ignoring the meaning.\n",

    "In the Stroop task, stimuli where the color and the meaning of the word match (<span style=\"color:red\">RED</span>, <span style=\"color:blue\">BLUE</span>) are called congruent stimuli. Stimuli where the color and meaning mismatch (<span style=\"color:blue\">RED</span>, <span style=\"color:red\">BLUE</span>) are called incongruent. It is an extremely robust psychological finding that congruent stimuli lead to faster and more accurate responses than incongruent stimuli. This phenomenon is called `congruency effect`."

In other words, there is no sensible crossing between *color*, *word* and *congruency* since some level combinations are impossible. This is often the case when dealing with \"derived factors\". \"Derived factors\" are factors that depend on other factors. For example, the *congruency* depends on the stimulus *color* and its *word* and solely derives from these factors.\n",
