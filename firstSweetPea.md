# 4. sweetPea: Create a task sequence

In the previous tutorial, we learned how to use feature timelines for our experiments. Here, we learn how to use `sweetPea` to create such timelines. `sweetPea` is a python package. In this tutorial, we use jupiter notebooks. You can either download the notebook and use it in your preferred program or you can use google colab to run it in the browser.
